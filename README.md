# GaN_interview_programs

In the interview program directory is the FizzBuzz python project I put together.

Pytests are located in fizzBuzzPlus_test.py.

To see the output, run the run.sh script.

I have also included a couple code snippets that I worked on to get my mind working for interviews. They are located in the code_challenges_prep directory. The link to the problem is in a comment at the top of the files.
